This project is inspired by [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) for Swift. It provides
matchers and matcher functions to express expectations in tests for common cases, such as:
Equality, Order, Option, Result, etc.  The crate also provides instruments to implement custom
matchers for your project's domain.
